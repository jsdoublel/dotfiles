# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my [i3](https://i3wm.org/) [EndeavorOS](https://endeavouros.com/) desktop. Many of the scripts, etc., are not original to me. Clone the repo with `--recursive` in order to obtain all the submodules.

The directory layout is desgined with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) in mind. For instance, if you cloned the repo into your home folder, running `stow i3-endeavoros` would install the i3 configs and other configs relevant to my desktop setup (like rofi, etc.).
